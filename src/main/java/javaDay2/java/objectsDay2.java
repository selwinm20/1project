//Java Classes/Objects
//Java is an object-oriented programming language.
//
//Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
//
//A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
