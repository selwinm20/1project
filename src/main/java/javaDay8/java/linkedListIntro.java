    //ArrayList vs. LinkedList
//The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList.
//
//The LinkedList class has all of the same methods as the ArrayList class because they both implement the List interface. This means that you can add items, change items, remove items and clear the list in the same way.
//
//However, while the ArrayList class and the LinkedList class can be used in the same way, they are built very differently.

    //LinkedList:
    //
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList<String> Students = new LinkedList<>();
        Students.addFirst("Selwin");
        Students.addLast(" Mazariegos");
    }



    //STACK
    //LIFO: Last in First Out



}
